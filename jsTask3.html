        <p>
            In JS, they both are related to memory space and there is a very simple difference between them. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If the variable name which is being accessed doesn't exist in memory space, then it would be not defined.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the variable name which is being accessed exists in memory space but hasn't been assigned any value till now, then it would be undefined.
